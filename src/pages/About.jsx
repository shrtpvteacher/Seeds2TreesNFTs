          <h2>About Seeds2TreesNFTs</h2>
          <p>
            Seeds2TreesNFTs is a blockchain-powered donation platform where every minted NFT
            represents a real-world tree. Each NFT begins as a placeholder, and over time,
            it transforms into a digital record of an actual planted tree ‚Äî including its
            location and planting date.
          </p>
          <p>
            By merging transparency and sustainability, this project provides long-term
            tracking for environmental impact. Whether you're an individual, organization,
            or future conservation partner, your donations help build a forest with roots
            in real life and permanence on-chain.
