# 🌱 Seeds2Trees NFT Donation DApp

**Seeds2Trees** is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to donate ETH to plant trees in the redwood forest and receive an NFT in return.  

Seeds2TreesNFTs is a tree planting donation project that tracks the process from donation funding to planting of each tree.  Each NFT represent a real tree and can be used to track the tree planted by the buyers donation. 

Upon minting an NFT can be seen in the Gallery page and the statistics are tracked below the int function on the home page.  There is also a visual chart for total Donations.

Inside the NFT Gallery page when a tree is planted that particular NFT tokenID will have a button linked to the location that tree was planted as it connects to Google Earth.

There is also an Admin page where the contract owner can call on the smart contract to change the mint price, to enter the tree planting coordinates for a particular tokenId, to withdraw funds sent to the contract to cover the tree planting costs and a function to change the image base uri which allows a changing of the NFT images as they can be changed to be images of the trees planted but for now they are art generated by the contract dev as place holders.

The dApp is built with React, Ethers.js, a smart contract written in Solidity and images are stored in IPFS.

# 1. Clone the repository


git clone https://github.com/shrtpvteacher/seeds2treesnfts.git 
cd seeds2treesnfts
git remote remove origin (so you can push your commits to github in your own repository)

# 2. Install dependencies

npm install

# 3. Set up environment variables (if needed)

If you're using Infura or Alchemy for your RPC URL, create a .env file:

Warning.....place .env file inside .gitignore !!!!!

example:  

VITE_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/YOUR_KEY
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourDeployedContractAddress
PRIVATE_KEY=YourPrivateKeyForMetamaskDevWallet
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=YourEtherscanAPIKey
